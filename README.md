<br><B>Validate Everything is Working</B>
* Attempt to connect WebStorm and Github.
  * If not in a prompted area, when opening/creating a project (possibly in an empty looking "Search Project Screen")
    * Click on: "Get From VCS"
  * GitHub should be an option which you should select (sign-in manually if not already prompted to link)
    * If it asks for a "file location" (don't change it, unless the following steps do not work)
  * There should be a list of projects (or in this case, just 1 that was created earlier), and click on the "bottom-right" option "Clone"
    * IF this doesn't work:
      * In WebStorms: Go to menu option in the top left "File" and select Settings (or use the keybinds: "Crtl+Alt+S")
        * Browse options
